# Vue EP (entrypoint)
Vue Entrypoint Router experiment

## Conclusion
Failed as this is not super feasible in a simple way, and would require quite alot of infra code to make this work right, plus the benefit of this isnt really that much right now, since many smaller SPAs could be as beneficial as one big MPA in this situation.
